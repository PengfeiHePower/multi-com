There are also seven perfect cubes less than 441: $1^3, 2^3, \\ldots, 7^3$. So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\nBut wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice. Similarly, we've counted any sixth power less than 441 twice because any sixth power is both a square and a cube at the same time. Fortunately, the only other such one is $2^6=64$. Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes.

Each part represents the number of balls in a box, and since the boxes are indistinguishable, the order of the parts does not matter.\n\n### Step 1: Find the partitions of 4\n\nWe can list the partitions of 4 into at most 3 parts:\n\n1. \\(4\\) (all balls in one box)\n2. \\(3 + 1\\) (three balls in one box, one ball in another)\n3. \\(2 + 2\\) (two balls in one box, two balls in another)\n4. \\(2 + 1 + 1\\) (two balls in one box, one ball in each of the others)\n\n### Step 2: Count the arrangements for each partition\n\nNext, we will calculate how many ways we can assign the distinguishable balls to each of these partitions.\n\n1. **Partition \\(4\\)**:\n   - All 4 balls in one box: There is only 1 way to do this.\n\n2. **Partition \\(3 + 1\\)**:\n   - Choose 3 balls to go into one box and 1 ball to go into another. The number of ways to choose 3 balls from 4 is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Partition \\(2 + 2\\)**:\n   - Choose 2 balls to go into one box and the remaining 2 balls will go into the other box. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 4 is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n   However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we must divide by 2 to account for the fact that choosing balls A and B for the first box and C and D for the second box is the same as choosing C and D for the first box and A and B for the second box. Thus, the number of ways for this partition is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Partition \\(2 + 1 + 1\\)**:\n   - Choose 2 balls to go into one box, and the other 2 balls will each go into their own boxes. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 4 is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Sum the counts from all partitions\n\nNow, we sum the number of arrangements for each partition:\n\n- From partition \\(4\\): \\(1\\)\n- From partition \\(3 + 1\\): \\(4\\)\n- From partition \\(2 + 2\\): \\(3\\)\n- From partition \\(2 + 1 + 1\\): \\(6\\)\n\nThus, the total number of ways to distribute the balls is:\n\\[\n1 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 14\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]"

The discussion between the solvers provides a comprehensive and logical approach to solving this problem. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and calculations:\n\n1. **Total Outcomes**: The total number of ways to choose 2 teams from 3 is calculated using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   The possible pairs of teams are:\n   - Team A and Team B\n   - Team A and Team C\n   - Team B and Team C\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**: The next step is to find the scenarios where Team A is selected at least twice in three days. This is broken down into two cases:\n   - **Case 1**: Team A is selected exactly twice.\n   - **Case 2**: Team A is selected exactly three times.\n\n   **Case 1**: If Team A is selected exactly twice, the combinations can be represented as:\n   - AAB\n   - AAC\n   - ABA\n   - ACA\n   - BAA\n   - CAA\n   The number of ways to choose 2 days for Team A out of 3 is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   For each of these combinations, Team A can pair with either Team B or Team C on the remaining day, leading to:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ (ways to choose days)} \\times 2 \\text{ (choices for the third team)} = 6\n   \\]\n\n   **Case 2**: If Team A is selected all three days, there is only one combination:\n   - AAA\n   Thus, there is exactly 1 way for this case.\n\n3. **Total Favorable Outcomes**: Summing the favorable outcomes from both cases gives:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ (from Case 1)} + 1 \\text{ (from Case 2)} = 7\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Possible Outcomes**: The total number of outcomes over three days, where each day has 3 possible pairs of teams, is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   3^3 = 27\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that Team A is selected at least twice is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{A selected at least twice}) = \\frac{7}{27}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculations and reasoning presented are sound, and the final answer is well-supported. Therefore, the probability that Team A is selected at least twice over the next three days is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{27}}\n\\]\n\nThis conclusion is robust, and the steps taken to arrive at it are clear and logical, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the problem."

Team A is selected on any given day with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$, because there are ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ possible pairs of teams, and 2 of them contain A. So, there is a $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27}$ chance of being selected all three days.

            "Judge": "FINAL ANSWER: 0\n\nEXPLANATION: The problem requires us to determine the number of ways to divide 12 dimes into three piles such that each pile contains an odd number of dimes. The analysis provided by Solver_1 and confirmed by Solver_2 follows a logical and mathematical approach to arrive at the conclusion.\n\n1. **Understanding Odd Numbers**: An odd number can be expressed in the form \\(2k + 1\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This is crucial because the sum of three odd numbers is always odd.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**: The total number of dimes is given as:\n   \\[\n   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 12\n   \\]\n   where \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) represent the number of dimes in each pile. If we express each \\(x_i\\) as an odd number, we can write:\n   \\[\n   x_1 = 2a + 1, \\quad x_2 = 2b + 1, \\quad x_3 = 2c + 1\n   \\]\n   for non-negative integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Equation**: Substituting these expressions into the total gives:\n   \\[\n   (2a + 1) + (2b + 1) + (2c + 1) = 12\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this leads to:\n   \\[\n   2a + 2b + 2c + 3 = 12\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   2a + 2b + 2c = 9\n   \\]\n   Dividing by 2 results in:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = \\frac{9}{2}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\) is not an integer, it is impossible to find non-negative integer solutions for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since it is impossible to divide 12 dimes into three piles with each pile containing an odd number of dimes, the total number of ways to do this is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0}\n   \\]\n\nThis conclusion is robust and well-supported by the logical reasoning and mathematical principles applied throughout the analysis."

The elements of Row 6 are:\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\n   Thus, the complete row is:\n   \\[\n   1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the Primes**: Now we check which of these numbers are prime:\n   - \\(1\\) is not prime.\n   - \\(6\\) is not prime (divisible by \\(2\\) and \\(3\\)).\n   - \\(15\\) is not prime (divisible by \\(3\\) and \\(5\\)).\n   - \\(20\\) is not prime (divisible by \\(2\\) and \\(5\\)).\n   - \\(15\\) (again) is not prime.\n   - \\(6\\) (again) is not prime.\n   - \\(1\\) (again) is not prime.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since none of the numbers in Row 6 of Pascal's Triangle are prime, the total number of primes in this row is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0}\n   \\]\n\nThis conclusion is well-supported by the calculations and reasoning presented, ensuring that all aspects of the problem have been considered accurately.
