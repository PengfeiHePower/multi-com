The quantum efficiency (QE) of 0.1 means that for every 100 photons that hit the detector, we expect it to successfully detect 10 of them on average.\n\n1. **Average Detection**: Since the QE is 0.1, if we send 100 photons, the expected number of detected photons (average) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average detected photons} = 100 \\times 0.1 = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **RMS Deviation**: The detection of photons can be modeled as a binomial distribution, where the number of trials (n) is 100 (the number of photons sent), and the probability of success (p) is 0.1 (the quantum efficiency).

The centripetal force \\( F_c \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the coin, \\( v \\) is the tangential speed of the coin, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the turntable.\n\n2. **Frictional Force**: The maximum static frictional force \\( F_f \\) that can act on the coin is given by:\n   \\[\n   F_f = \\mu_s N\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mu_s \\) is the coefficient of static friction and \\( N \\) is the normal force. For a horizontal surface, the normal force \\( N \\) is equal to the weight of the coin:\n   \\[\n   N = mg\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the maximum static frictional force becomes:\n   \\[\n   F_f = \\mu_s mg\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting Forces Equal**: For the coin to not slide, the maximum static frictional force must equal the centripetal force:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_s mg = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n   \\]\n   The mass \\( m \\) cancels out:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_s g = \\frac{v^2}{r}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Tangential Speed**: The tangential speed \\( v \\) can be calculated from the rotational speed of the turntable. The turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute (RPM). First, we convert this to radians per second:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Angular velocity} \\, \\omega = 33.3 \\, \\text{rev/min} \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\, \\text{rad}}{1 \\, \\text{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{min}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = \\frac{33.3 \\times 2\\pi}{60} \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{rad/s}\n   \\]\n   The tangential speed \\( v \\) is related to the angular velocity by:\n   \\[\n   v = r \\omega\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substituting for \\( v \\)**: Substituting \\( v = r \\omega \\) into the centripetal force equation gives:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_s g = \\frac{(r \\omega)^2}{r} = r \\omega^2\n   \\]\n   Rearranging for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{\\mu_s g}{\\omega^2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating \\( r \\)**: Now we can substitute the values:\n   - \\( \\mu_s = 0.30 \\)\n   - \\( g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n   - \\( \\omega \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\)\n\n   Plugging in these values:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.81}{(3.49)^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{2.943}{12.18} \\approx 0.242 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is:\n\n**D) 0.242 m.**\n\nIf there are any further questions or discussions regarding friction, circular motion, or related topics, I encourage you to share!"
