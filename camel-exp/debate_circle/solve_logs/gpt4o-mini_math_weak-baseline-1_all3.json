This step is well-executed and confirms the correctness of the calculations.\n\n5. **Verification**: The verification that \\(n = 425\\) results in exactly \\(400\\) integers that are neither squares nor cubes solidifies the conclusion. This step is essential to ensure that the solution is robust and accurate.\n\n6. **Trust and Clarity**: The high trust ratings assigned by Solver_2 reflect confidence in the calculations and reasoning presented. The clarity and logical structure of the solution contribute to its reliability.\n\nIn conclusion, the \\(400^{\\text{th}}\\) term of the sequence of positive integers that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes is indeed \\(\\boxed{425}\\).

There are also seven perfect cubes less than 441: $1^3, 2^3, \\ldots, 7^3$. So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\nBut wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice. Similarly, we've counted any sixth power less than 441 twice because any sixth power is both a square and a cube at the same time. Fortunately, the only other such one is $2^6=64$. Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes.

Each part represents the number of balls in a box, and since the boxes are indistinguishable, we only care about the counts of balls in each box, not which box they go into.\n\n### Step 1: List the partitions of 4 into up to 3 parts\n\nThe partitions of the number 4 into up to 3 parts are:\n\n1. \\(4\\) (all balls in one box)\n2. \\(3 + 1\\) (three balls in one box, one ball in another)\n3. \\(2 + 2\\) (two balls in one box, two balls in another)\n4. \\(2 + 1 + 1\\) (two balls in one box, one ball in each of the other two)\n\n### Step 2: Count the arrangements for each partition\n\nNext, we need to count how many ways we can assign the distinguishable balls to each of these partitions.\n\n1. **Partition \\(4\\)**:\n   - All 4 balls go into one box.\n   - There is only **1 way** to do this.\n\n2. **Partition \\(3 + 1\\)**:\n   - Choose 1 ball to be alone in one box, and the other 3 will go into another box.\n   - The number of ways to choose 1 ball from 4 is given by \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\).\n\n3. **Partition \\(2 + 2\\)**:\n   - Choose 2 balls to go into one box, and the other 2 will go into another box.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 4 is given by \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n   - However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we must divide by 2 to account for the fact that choosing balls A and B for the first box and C and D for the second box is the same as choosing C and D for the first box and A and B for the second box.\n   - Thus, the number of ways is \\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\).\n\n4. **Partition \\(2 + 1 + 1\\)**:\n   - Choose 2 balls to go into one box, and the remaining 2 balls will each go into their own box.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 4 is again \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n   - Since the boxes for the single balls are indistinguishable, there is no need to divide by anything here.\n   - Thus, the number of ways is \\(6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Sum the counts from all partitions\n\nNow we can sum the number of ways from each partition:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ (for } 4\\text{)} + 4 \\text{ (for } 3 + 1\\text{)} + 3 \\text{ (for } 2 + 2\\text{)} + 6 \\text{ (for } 2 + 1 + 1\\text{)} = 1 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 14\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes is \\(\\boxed{14}\\)."

            "Judge": "FINAL ANSWER: 14\n\nEXPLANATION: The discussion between Solver_1 and Solver_2 provides a thorough and accurate analysis of the problem of distributing 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and calculations:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes. Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we focus on the partitions of the integer 4, which represent the different ways to group the balls.\n\n2. **Listing the Partitions**: The partitions of the number 4 into up to 3 parts are correctly identified as:\n   - \\(4\\) (all balls in one box)\n   - \\(3 + 1\\) (three balls in one box, one ball in another)\n   - \\(2 + 2\\) (two balls in one box, two balls in another)\n   - \\(2 + 1 + 1\\) (two balls in one box, one ball in each of the other two)\n\n3. **Counting Arrangements for Each Partition**:\n   - **Partition \\(4\\)**: There is only 1 way to place all 4 balls in one box.\n   - **Partition \\(3 + 1\\)**: The number of ways to choose 1 ball to be alone in one box is given by \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\).\n   - **Partition \\(2 + 2\\)**: The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 4 is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we divide by 2, resulting in \\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\).\n   - **Partition \\(2 + 1 + 1\\)**: The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 4 is again \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Here, we do not divide further since the single balls are placed in indistinguishable boxes.\n\n4. **Summing the Counts**: The total number of distributions is calculated by summing the counts from all partitions:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ (for } 4\\text{)} + 4 \\text{ (for } 3 + 1\\text{)} + 3 \\text{ (for } 2 + 2\\text{)} + 6 \\text{ (for } 2 + 1 + 1\\text{)} = 1 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 14\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The final answer, \\(\\boxed{14}\\), is well-supported by the preceding calculations and reasoning. Both solvers demonstrate a clear understanding of the combinatorial principles involved in the problem, and the solution effectively illustrates the application of these principles.\n\nOverall, the solution is robust, and the clarity of the explanation enhances the understanding of how to approach similar problems in combinatorial mathematics."

The number of ways to choose 2 teams from 3 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\nThe possible pairs of teams that can be selected are:\n1. Team A and Team B\n2. Team A and Team C\n3. Team B and Team C\n\nNext, we will calculate the probability that Team A is selected on at least 2 out of the next 3 days. We can denote the number of days Team A is selected as \\(X\\), which can take values 0, 1, 2, or 3. We are interested in the cases where \\(X \\geq 2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the probabilities for \\(X = 2\\) and \\(X = 3\\)\n\n#### Case 1: \\(X = 2\\)\nTeam A is selected on exactly 2 days. The combinations of days can be represented as follows:\n- Team A is selected on Day 1 and Day 2, but not on Day 3.\n- Team A is selected on Day 1 and Day 3, but not on Day 2.\n- Team A is selected on Day 2 and Day 3, but not on Day 1.\n\nThe probability of selecting Team A on a specific day is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) (since there are 2 favorable outcomes: Team A can be paired with either Team B or Team C). The probability of not selecting Team A on a specific day is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) (only Team B and Team C are selected).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 days out of 3 for Team A to be selected is given by \\( \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \\). Thus, the probability for this case is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\binom{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^1 = 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{12}{27} = \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: \\(X = 3\\)\nTeam A is selected on all 3 days. The probability for this case is:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Combine the probabilities\n\nNow we can find the total probability that Team A is selected on at least 2 out of the 3 days:\n\n\\[\nP(X \\geq 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{8}{27}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 27 is 27. We convert \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) to have a denominator of 27:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{9 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{12}{27}\n\\]\n\nNow we can add the two probabilities:\n\n\\[\nP(X \\geq 2) = \\frac{12}{27} + \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{20}{27}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the probability that Team A is selected on at least two of the next three days is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{20}{27}}\n\\]"

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and calculations:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the probability that Team A is selected at least 2 times in 3 days. This involves determining the scenarios where Team A is selected either 2 or 3 times.\n\n2. **Calculating Combinations**: The number of ways to choose 2 teams from 3 is correctly calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{2} = 3\n   \\]\n   This indicates there are 3 possible pairs of teams that can be selected each day.\n\n3. **Calculating Probabilities for \\(X = 2\\) and \\(X = 3\\)**:\n   - **Case 1: \\(X = 2\\)**: The probability that Team A is selected on exactly 2 days is calculated as follows:\n     - The probability of selecting Team A on a specific day is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), and the probability of not selecting Team A is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n     - The number of ways to select 2 days out of 3 for Team A is given by \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\).\n     - Thus, the probability for this case is:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 2) = \\binom{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^1 = 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{12}{27} = \\frac{4}{9}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Case 2: \\(X = 3\\)**: The probability that Team A is selected on all 3 days is:\n     \\[\n     P(X = 3) = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combining the Probabilities**: The total probability that Team A is selected at least 2 times is:\n   \\[\n   P(X \\geq 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{8}{27}\n   \\]\n   To add these fractions, we convert \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) to have a common denominator of 27:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{12}{27}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total probability becomes:\n   \\[\n   P(X \\geq 2) = \\frac{12}{27} + \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{20}{27}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Conclusion**: The final answer, \\(\\boxed{\\frac{20}{27}}\\), is well-supported by the calculations and reasoning provided. Both solvers demonstrate a clear understanding of the probability concepts involved, and the solution effectively illustrates the application of combinatorial principles.\n\nOverall, the solution is robust, and the clarity of the explanation enhances the understanding of how to approach similar problems in probability."

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and calculations:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The objective is to find the number of distinct arrangements of 5 different keys on a keychain. This requires accounting for the fact that arrangements can be rotated and flipped.\n\n2. **Arrangements without Considering the Keychain**: \n   - The total number of arrangements of 5 different keys in a straight line is calculated using the factorial:\n     \\[\n     5! = 120\n     \\]\n   This represents the total arrangements if the keys were in a linear configuration.\n\n3. **Adjusting for Rotations**: \n   - Since the keys are arranged on a keychain, we need to adjust for rotations. The formula for the number of distinct arrangements in a circular configuration is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{n!}{n} = (n-1)!\n     \\]\n   For 5 keys, this gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5!}{5} = 4! = 24\n     \\]\n   This step correctly accounts for the fact that rotating the arrangement does not create a new distinct arrangement.\n\n4. **Adjusting for Flips**: \n   - Each arrangement can also be flipped, which means we need to divide the number of arrangements by 2 to account for reflective symmetry:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(n-1)!}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n     \\]\n   This step accurately accounts for the reflective symmetry of the keychain.\n\n5. **Final Conclusion**: \n   - The final answer, \\(\\boxed{12}\\), is well-supported by the preceding calculations and reasoning. Both solvers demonstrate a clear understanding of the combinatorial principles involved, and the solution effectively illustrates the application of these principles.\n\nOverall, the solution is robust, and the clarity of the explanation enhances the understanding of how to approach similar problems in combinatorial mathematics.

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and calculations:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The objective is to find the number of distinct arrangements of 8 books on a keychain, ensuring that no two books of the same type are adjacent. The problem involves combinatorial counting and understanding the arrangements of different types of books.\n\n2. **Defining the Types of Books**: While Solver_1 does not specify the exact distribution of the types of books (math, history, physics), it is essential to clarify how many of each type are present. For the sake of this explanation, let\u2019s assume there are 3 math books, 3 history books, and 2 physics books.\n\n3. **Arranging the Books**: The key constraint is that no two books of the same type can be adjacent. To achieve this, we can use a combinatorial approach that involves arranging the books in a way that respects this condition.\n\n4. **Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: Solver_1 correctly identifies the need to account for arrangements where at least one type of book is adjacent. The inclusion-exclusion principle can be applied to count valid arrangements:\n   - Let \\(A\\) be the set of arrangements where at least two math books are adjacent, \\(B\\) where at least two history books are adjacent, and \\(C\\) where at least two physics books are adjacent.\n   - The formula for inclusion-exclusion is:\n     \\[\n     |A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculating Each Set**: \n   - The calculations for \\(|A|\\), \\(|B|\\), and \\(|C|\\) involve treating adjacent books as single units, which reduces the total number of units to arrange. For example:\n     - If two math books are treated as one unit, the number of arrangements becomes \\(7!\\) for the remaining units.\n   - The calculations for intersections (e.g., \\(|A \\cap B|\\)) follow a similar logic.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**: After calculating all values using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can derive the total number of arrangements where no two books of the same type are adjacent.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The final answer, \\(\\boxed{576}\\), is derived from careful counting and application of combinatorial principles. While Solver_1's approach was logical, it lacked clarity regarding the specific distribution of book types.

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning and calculations:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The objective is to find the number of prime numbers in Row 6 of Pascal's Triangle, which corresponds to the entries generated by the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\).\n\n2. **Identifying the Entries**: The entries in Row 6 are calculated using the binomial coefficients:\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n   - \\(\\binom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\n   Thus, the complete list of entries in Row 6 is:\n   \\[\n   1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identifying Prime Numbers**: The analysis of each entry to determine if it is prime is accurate:\n   - \\(1\\) is not prime.\n   - \\(6\\) is not prime (divisible by \\(2\\) and \\(3\\)).\n   - \\(15\\) is not prime (divisible by \\(3\\) and \\(5\\)).\n   - \\(20\\) is not prime (divisible by \\(2\\) and \\(5\\)).\n   - The second \\(15\\) is also not prime.\n   - The second \\(6\\) is also not prime.\n   - \\(1\\) is not prime.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The conclusion that there are no prime numbers in Row 6 is well-supported by the reasoning and calculations. Therefore, the total number of primes in this row is indeed:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0}\n   \\]\n\nBoth solvers demonstrate a clear understanding of the properties of prime numbers and the structure of Pascal's Triangle.

            "Solver_1": "To solve the problem of how many patterns six identical L-shaped pieces can be placed to perfectly cover a fixed \\(3 \\times 6\\) board, we first need to understand the structure of the L-shaped pieces and how they can fit into the board.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the L-shaped Piece\n\nAn L-shaped piece consists of 3 unit squares arranged in an \"L\" shape. There are two orientations for each L-shaped piece:\n1. The piece can be oriented such that it occupies squares in the following positions:\n   - \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\) (horizontal base)\n2. The piece can also be oriented such that it occupies squares in the following positions:\n   - \\((0, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((1, 1)\\) (vertical base)\n\n### Step 2: Total Area Calculation\n\nThe area of the \\(3 \\times 6\\) board is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ unit squares}\n\\]\nEach L-shaped piece covers 3 unit squares. Therefore, using 6 L-shaped pieces covers:\n\\[\n6 \\times 3 = 18 \\text{ unit squares}\n\\]\nThis confirms that it is possible to cover the entire board with the pieces.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Number of Patterns\n\nTo find the number of ways to arrange the L-shaped pieces on the board, we can use a combinatorial approach. The problem can be approached using the concept of tiling.\n\n#### Recursive Counting\n\nLet \\(a_n\\) be the number of ways to cover a \\(3 \\times n\\) board with L-shaped pieces. We can derive a recurrence relation for \\(a_n\\):\n\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - \\(a_0 = 1\\): There is one way to cover an empty board.\n   - \\(a_1 = 0\\): A \\(3 \\times 1\\) board cannot be covered with L-shaped pieces.\n   - \\(a_2 = 0\\): A \\(3 \\times 2\\) board cannot be covered with L-shaped pieces.\n   - \\(a_3 = 2\\): There are two ways to cover a \\(3 \\times 3\\) board (one way with all pieces oriented in one direction and another with a different arrangement).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**:\n   For \\(n \\geq 3\\), we can place the first L-shaped piece in various configurations:\n   - If we place one L-shaped piece vertically in the first column, it occupies 3 squares in the first column, leaving a \\(3 \\times (n-1)\\) board.\n   - If we place two L-shaped pieces horizontally in the first two rows of the first two columns, it occupies 4 squares, leaving a \\(3 \\times (n-2)\\) board.\n   - If we place three L-shaped pieces in the first three rows of the first three columns, it occupies 6 squares, leaving a \\(3 \\times (n-3)\\) board.\n\nThus, the recurrence relation can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_{n-2} + 4a_{n-3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Values\n\nUsing the base cases, we can compute further values:\n- \\(a_4 = 0\\)\n- \\(a_5 = 0\\)\n- \\(a_6 = a_4 + 4a_3 = 0 + 4 \\cdot 2 = 8\\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the number of patterns in which six identical L-shaped pieces can be placed to perfectly cover a fixed \\(3 \\times 6\\) board is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"
