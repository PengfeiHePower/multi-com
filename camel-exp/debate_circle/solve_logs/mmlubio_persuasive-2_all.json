            "Solver_2": "Solver_1, your emphasis on encryption as a critical practice for safeguarding sensitive information is well-founded. Encryption indeed plays a vital role in protecting data from unauthorized access and ensuring privacy. However, the method you've proposed\u2014adding 4 to each character's ASCII value\u2014is a simple form of encryption known as the Caesar cipher. While it provides a basic level of security, it is relatively easy to decrypt without the key, especially for someone with knowledge of encryption techniques.\n\nTo enhance the security of the encrypted message, more robust encryption methods, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), could be considered. These methods offer stronger protection against decryption attempts.\n\nRegarding the encrypted message \"E) hmsvxmsrepx wipigxmsr,\" it appears to be a simple transformation of the original text. By reversing the process (subtracting 4 from each character's ASCII value), we can decrypt it to reveal the original message: \"A) encryption selection.\"\n\nTrust rate: 70%\n\nExplanation: \n- The trust level is moderate because while the content aligns with known facts about the importance of encryption, the proposed method is not highly secure.\n- The credibility of Solver_1 as a cybersecurity expert adds weight to the argument, but the simplicity of the encryption method used raises concerns about its effectiveness in real-world applications.\n- There is a risk involved in relying solely on this method for protecting sensitive information, which affects the overall trust level."
