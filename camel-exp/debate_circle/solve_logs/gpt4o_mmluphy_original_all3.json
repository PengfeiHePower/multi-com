The key to understanding this difference lies in the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. This principle has significant implications for the spatial distribution of electrons and their interactions.\n\nIn the ortho-state of helium, where the electrons have parallel spins, the Pauli exclusion principle forces the electrons to occupy different spatial orbitals. This spatial separation reduces electron-electron repulsion compared to the para-state, where electrons with antiparallel spins can occupy the same spatial region, leading to increased repulsion. The reduced repulsion in the ortho-state results in lower energy compared to the para-state.\n\nThe other options do not adequately explain the energy differences:\n- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle (A) is fundamental to quantum mechanics but does not directly address the energy differences between these states.\n- The Bohr model of the atom (C) is an early model that does not account for electron spin or detailed electron-electron interactions.\n- Nuclear hyperfine coupling (D) involves interactions between nuclear and electron spins, which are typically smaller effects and not the primary reason for the energy difference in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation for why an ortho-state has lower energy than a para-state in helium is B) The Pauli exclusion principle."

The key forces to consider are the centripetal force required to keep the coin in circular motion and the static frictional force that prevents the coin from sliding.\n\n1. **Centripetal Force**: The centripetal force \\( F_c \\) necessary to maintain the coin's circular motion is given by:\n   \\[\n   F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the coin, \\( v \\) is the tangential velocity, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the center.\n\n2. **Static Friction**: The maximum static frictional force \\( F_s \\) that can act on the coin is:\n   \\[\n   F_s = \\mu_s mg\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mu_s = 0.30 \\) is the coefficient of static friction, and \\( g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n3. **Condition for No Sliding**: For the coin to remain stationary relative to the turntable, the static frictional force must be equal to or greater than the centripetal force:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_s mg \\geq \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   r \\leq \\frac{v^2}{\\mu_s g}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relating Velocity and Angular Velocity**: The tangential velocity \\( v \\) is related to the angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) by:\n   \\[\n   v = \\omega r\n   \\]\n   The angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) in radians per second is:\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 33.3}{60} \\approx 3.49 \\, \\text{rad/s}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substituting Values**: Substituting \\( v = \\omega r \\) into the inequality and solving for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r \\leq \\frac{\\mu_s g}{\\omega^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r \\leq \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.81}{(3.49)^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r \\leq \\frac{2.943}{12.1801} \\approx 0.2417 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is approximately 0.242 m, corresponding to option D.

This principle is fundamental in quantum mechanics and plays a crucial role in determining the spatial distribution and energy levels of electrons in atoms.\n\n1. **Ortho- and Para-States**: In helium, the ortho-state refers to the configuration where the two electrons have parallel spins, while the para-state refers to the configuration where the electrons have antiparallel spins.\n\n2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: This principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. As a result, electrons with parallel spins (ortho-state) must occupy different spatial orbitals. This spatial separation reduces electron-electron repulsion compared to the para-state, where electrons with antiparallel spins can occupy the same spatial region, leading to increased repulsion.\n\n3. **Energy Implications**: The reduced electron-electron repulsion in the ortho-state results in lower energy compared to the para-state. This is because the spatial separation of electrons in the ortho-state minimizes the repulsive forces between them, leading to a more stable (lower energy) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation for why an ortho-state has lower energy than a para-state in helium is B) The Pauli exclusion principle. This principle effectively explains the energy differences based on the spatial distribution and interactions of electrons."

            "Judge": "FINAL ANSWER: A\n\nEXPLANATION: The problem involves calculating the work done on a particle to accelerate it to a speed of 0.6c, where relativistic effects must be considered due to the significant fraction of the speed of light involved. The work done is equivalent to the change in the particle's relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n1. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy Formula**: The kinetic energy \\( K \\) in the relativistic regime is given by:\n   \\[\n   K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor, \\( m \\) is the rest mass of the particle, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\n2. **Lorentz Factor Calculation**: The Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\n   \\]\n   For \\( v = 0.6c \\), the calculation is:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute into Kinetic Energy Equation**: Substituting the calculated \\( \\gamma \\) into the kinetic energy equation gives:\n   \\[\n   K = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2\n   \\]\n\nThus, the work done on the particle to accelerate it to a speed of 0.6c is \\( 0.25mc^2 \\). This calculation is consistent with the principles of relativistic mechanics, and both solvers have confirmed the correctness of this approach. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 0.25mc^2."
