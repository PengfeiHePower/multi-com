The steps outlined include:\n\n1. Counting the perfect squares up to \\(n\\) using \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\).\n2. Counting the perfect cubes up to \\(n\\) using \\( \\lfloor n^{1/3} \\rfloor \\).\n3. Counting the perfect sixth powers (which are both squares and cubes) using \\( \\lfloor n^{1/6} \\rfloor \\) to avoid double counting.\n4. Applying the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the total count of integers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n5. Finally, calculating the count of integers that are neither squares nor cubes and setting this equal to 400 to find the appropriate \\(n\\).\n\nThrough iterative testing of values for \\(n\\), Solver_1 finds that \\(n = 425\\) results in exactly 400 integers that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. This is confirmed by the calculations showing that:\n\n- The count of perfect squares up to 425 is \\(20\\).\n- The count of perfect cubes up to 425 is \\(7\\).\n- The count of perfect sixth powers up to 425 is \\(2\\).\n- Thus, the total count of excluded integers is \\(20 + 7 - 2 = 25\\).\n- Therefore, the count of integers that are neither squares nor cubes is \\(425 - 25 = 400\\).\n\nThis systematic approach, along with the final verification, leads to the conclusion that the \\(400^{\\text{th}}\\) term of the sequence is indeed \\(425\\). The clarity and thoroughness of Solver_1's solution, as well as the validation provided by Solver_2, reinforce the accuracy of this conclusion."

There are also seven perfect cubes less than 441: $1^3, 2^3, \\ldots, 7^3$. So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\nBut wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice. Similarly, we've counted any sixth power less than 441 twice because any sixth power is both a square and a cube at the same time. Fortunately, the only other such one is $2^6=64$. Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes. Thus, the $400^{\\text{th}}$ term is $\\boxed{425}$."

The number of ways to choose 2 teams from 3 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\). Therefore, the total number of outcomes over 3 days is:\n   \\[\n   3^3 = 27\n   \\]\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**: The next step is to count the favorable outcomes where Team A is selected at least 2 times. This is broken down into two cases:\n   - **Case 1**: Team A is selected exactly 2 times. The number of ways to choose 2 days from 3 for Team A is \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\). On the remaining day, Team A cannot be selected, so we can choose either Team B or Team C, giving us 2 choices. Thus, the total for this case is:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 2 = 6\n     \\]\n   - **Case 2**: Team A is selected all 3 days. Since Team A is selected every day, we can choose either Team B or Team C for each of the 3 days, resulting in:\n     \\[\n     2^3 = 8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Favorable Outcomes**: The total number of favorable outcomes from both cases is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 8 = 14\n   \\]\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: Finally, the probability that Team A is selected on at least 2 of the next 3 days is calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Team A selected at least 2 days}) = \\frac{14}{27}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is presented as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{14}{27}}\n\\]\n\nOverall, Solver_1's analysis is thorough and well-structured, leading to a clear conclusion that is validated by Solver_2's agreement with the reasoning and calculations."

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We denote the number of dimes in the three piles as \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\). The requirement is that each \\(x_i\\) must be an odd number, and their total must equal 12:\n   \\[\n   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expressing Odd Numbers**: Each \\(x_i\\) can be expressed in terms of non-negative integers \\(y_i\\) as:\n   \\[\n   x_i = 2y_i + 1\n   \\]\n   This transformation ensures that each \\(x_i\\) is odd.\n\n3. **Substituting into the Equation**: Substituting these expressions into the total gives:\n   \\[\n   (2y_1 + 1) + (2y_2 + 1) + (2y_3 + 1) = 12\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this results in:\n   \\[\n   2y_1 + 2y_2 + 2y_3 + 3 = 12\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   2y_1 + 2y_2 + 2y_3 = 9\n   \\]\n   Dividing by 2 leads to:\n   \\[\n   y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identifying the Impossibility**: Since \\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), and \\(y_3\\) must be integers, the equation \\(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\) cannot hold because \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\) is not an integer. This indicates that it is impossible to divide 12 dimes into three piles such that each pile has an odd number of dimes.\n\n5. **Final Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve this distribution is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0}\n   \\]\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the logical steps taken to analyze the problem, confirming that there are no valid distributions of the dimes under the given conditions."

We need to arrange a total of 8 books such that no two books of the same type are adjacent.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\nWe will first calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions and then subtract the cases where at least one type of book is adjacent.\n\n#### Total Arrangements Without Restrictions\n\nSince we have 3 types of books and each book can be any of the three types, the total number of arrangements of 8 books is:\n\n\\[\n3^8\n\\]\n\n#### Arrangements With Restrictions (Using Inclusion-Exclusion)\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the set of arrangements where at least two math books are adjacent, \\( B \\) be the set where at least two history books are adjacent, and \\( C \\) be the set where at least two physics books are adjacent.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Each Set\n\n1. **Calculate \\(|A|\\)** (at least two math books adjacent):\n\n   We can treat the two adjacent math books as a single block.

            "Judge": "FINAL ANSWER: 720\n\nEXPLANATION: The discussion between Solver_1 and Solver_2 provides a clear and logical approach to solving the problem of arranging the Smith family's 4 sons and 3 daughters in a row of 7 chairs, ensuring that all 3 daughters sit next to each other. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Treating Daughters as a Block**: Solver_1 correctly treats the 3 daughters as a single block, which simplifies the problem. By considering the daughters as one unit, the total number of units to arrange becomes 5 (4 sons + 1 block of daughters).\n\n2. **Arranging the Units**: The calculation of the number of ways to arrange these 5 units is accurately computed using \\(5!\\):\n   \\[\n   5! = 120\n   \\]\n   This step correctly reflects the number of arrangements of the units.\n\n3. **Arranging Daughters Within Their Block**: The calculation of the number of ways to arrange the 3 daughters within their block is also correct:\n   \\[\n   3! = 6\n   \\]\n   This accounts for the different arrangements of the daughters themselves.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Arrangements**: The final calculation of the total arrangements by multiplying the arrangements of the units by the arrangements of the daughters is clearly presented:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total arrangements} = 5! \\times 3! = 120 \\times 6 = 720\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Presentation**: The final answer is presented clearly in a boxed format, effectively highlighting the conclusion.\n\nOverall, Solver_1's analysis is thorough and well-reasoned, leading to the conclusion that the total number of ways the Smith family can be seated in a row of 7 chairs such that all 3 daughters sit next to each other is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{720}\n\\] \n\nThis solution accurately reflects the calculations and logical reasoning necessary to arrive at the correct answer."

Then, within each configuration, there are $4!$ ways in which we can assign the 4 sons to seats, and $3!$ ways in which we can assign the 3 daughters to seats.\n\nTherefore the number of possible seatings is $5 \\times 4! \\times 3! = \\boxed{720}$."
