Let's analyze this approach:\n\n1. **Encryption Method**: The method used is a basic form of encryption, akin to a Caesar cipher. While it adds a layer of security, it is relatively weak against determined attackers due to its simplicity. However, for the purpose of this discussion, it serves to illustrate the concept of encryption.\n\n2. **Encrypted Answer**: The encrypted answer is 'E'. To decrypt it, we would subtract 4 from the ASCII value of 'E', which is 69. This gives us 65, corresponding to the character 'A'.\n\n3. **Relevance to Problem**: The problem seems to involve providing an answer in an encrypted form. Solver_1 has demonstrated the encryption process effectively.\n\n4. **Trustworthiness**: Given Solver_1's claim of expertise in cybersecurity and the logical explanation of the encryption process, the information appears credible. However, the simplicity of the encryption method suggests it is not suitable for high-security needs.\n\nTrust rate: 85%\n- **Reasoning**: Solver_1's expertise lends credibility, and the explanation is logically sound.
