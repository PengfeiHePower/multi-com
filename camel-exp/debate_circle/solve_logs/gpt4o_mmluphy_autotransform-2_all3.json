The problem involves calculating the rms deviation for a detector with a quantum efficiency of 0.1 when 100 photons are sent. This scenario is best modeled using a binomial distribution, where the standard deviation (or rms deviation) is calculated using the formula \\(\\sqrt{n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)}\\). Here, \\(n\\) is the number of trials (100 photons), \\(p\\) is the probability of success (0.1), and \\(1-p\\) is the probability of failure (0.9).\n\nApplying this formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{rms deviation} = \\sqrt{100 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot 0.9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n\\]\n\nThis calculation shows that the rms deviation is 3, which corresponds to Option C.

The Bohr model was indeed a significant advancement in explaining the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, but it has limitations when it comes to more complex atoms. It does not account for electron spin, fine structure, or electron-electron interactions, which are crucial for a complete understanding of atomic energy levels.\n\nQuantum mechanics, including the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Pauli exclusion principle, offers a more complete framework for understanding atomic structure. These principles explain the arrangement of electrons in atoms, chemical bonding, and the structure of the periodic table. The Pauli exclusion principle, in particular, is essential for explaining why electrons occupy specific energy states and how they fill atomic orbitals.\n\nSolver_1's assertion that the Bohr model explains everything about atomic energy levels is an oversimplification. While the Bohr model was a foundational step, it is the principles of quantum mechanics that provide a comprehensive explanation of atomic energy levels. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B, which acknowledges the importance of quantum mechanics in explaining atomic energy levels."

            "Judge": "FINAL ANSWER: B\n\nEXPLANATION: Solver_2 provides a correct and detailed explanation of how to determine the total mechanical energy of a system. The total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE), which are fundamental concepts in physics. To accurately calculate the total mechanical energy, both forms of energy must be considered:\n\n1. **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: Given by the formula \\( KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( v \\) is the velocity of the object.\n\n2. **Potential Energy (PE)**: Depends on the system. For gravitational potential energy, it is given by \\( PE = mgh \\), where \\( h \\) is the height above a reference point. For elastic potential energy, it involves the spring constant and displacement.\n\nWithout specific details about the system, such as mass, velocity, height, or spring constant, it is not possible to definitively state that the total mechanical energy is 0.75 mJ. Solver_1's assertion that the total mechanical energy is 0.75 mJ without considering these calculations is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach is to rely on the principles outlined by Solver_2, which emphasize the importance of calculating both kinetic and potential energy to determine the total mechanical energy. Without specific values, the best answer cannot be Option D. Instead, the answer should be based on the correct application of physics principles, which Solver_2 highlights."
