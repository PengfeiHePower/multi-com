We first examine the known effects of auxin on plant cells. Auxin is primarily recognized for its role in promoting cell elongation, which it accomplishes by increasing the extensibility of cell walls. This allows cells to expand more easily, a critical factor in plant growth. Considering the provided options, Option B (Increased extensibility of the walls of affected cells) aligns precisely with this function. \nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion:Hawkmoths are insects that are similar in appearance and behavior to hummingbirds.

We must first evaluate the validity of statements concerning their evolutionary relationship and physical characteristics. Hawkmoths and hummingbirds are known for their convergent evolution, where each has independently evolved similar traits such as hovering and nectar feeding, despite being from different biological classes (insects and birds, respectively). This adaptation results from analogous structures like elongated feeding mechanisms, not from a common genetic ancestry. Therefore, the statement Option C, which claims that these organisms are genetically related, is the least valid.\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion:In a certain population of squirrels that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, black color is a recessive phenotype present in 9 percent of the squirrels, and 91 percent are gray.

We first determine the allele frequencies associated with squirrel coloration, where 9% of the population displays the recessive black phenotype. Then calculating the square root of it gives us q=0.3. Then the frequency of the dominant allele (p) can then be determined by subtracting q from 1, resulting in p=0.7. To find the percentage of the population that is homozygous dominant, we square p to get p^2=0.49 or 49%. \nAnswer: C", "badchain":"Please choose the correct option from the list of options to answer the question.
