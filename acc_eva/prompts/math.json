Answer can conclude the final answer.\nHere are some examples.\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?\nThought: Let's think step-by-step. Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches. \nAnswer: 36.\n\nQuestion: How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$\nThought: Let's think step-by-step. We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \\pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. \nAnswer: 4.\n\nQuestion: Find $r$ if $3(r-7) = 4(2-2r) + 4$.\nThought: Let's think step-by-step. Expanding both products gives \\[3r - 3\\cdot 7 = 4\\cdot 2 - 4\\cdot 2r + 4,\\] so $3r - 21 = 8 - 8r + 4$.  Simplifying the right-hand side gives $3r -21 = 12-8r$.  Adding $8r$ and 21 to both sides gives $11r = 33$, so $r=\\boxed{3}$.\nAnswer: 3\n\nQuestion: For real numbers $t,$ the point of intersection of the lines $x + 2y = 7t + 3$ and $x - y = 2t - 2$ is plotted.  All the plotted points lie on a line.  Find the slope of this line.\nThought: Let's think step-by-step. We find\n\\[x = \\frac{11t - 1}{3}, \\quad y = \\frac{5t + 5}{3}.\\]From the first equation,\n\\[t = \\frac{3x + 1}{11}.\\]Then\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{5t + 5}{3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5 \\cdot \\frac{3x + 1}{11} + 5}{3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5}{11} x + \\frac{20}{11},\n\\end{align*}Thus, the slope of the line is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{11}}.$\nAnswer: 5/11.\n\nQuestion: What is the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$?\nThought: Let's think step-by-step. By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.\nAnswer: -9\n\nQuestion: Find all real solutions to $x^4+(2-x)^4=34$.  Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.\nThought: Let's think step-by-step. Let $y = x - 1.$  Then $x = y + 1,$ and\n\\[(y + 1)^4 + (-y + 1)^4 = 34.\\]Expanding, we get $2y^4 + 12y^2 - 32 = 0.$  This factors as $2(y^2 - 2)(y^2 + 8) = 0,$ so $y = \\pm \\sqrt{2}.$  Thus, the solutions in $x$ are $\\boxed{1 + \\sqrt{2}, 1 - \\sqrt{2}}.$\nAnswer:[1-sqrt{2}, 1+sqrt{2}",
