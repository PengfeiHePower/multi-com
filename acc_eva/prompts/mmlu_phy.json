First When high-energy electrons strike a metal target, they can knock out inner-shell electrons from the metal atoms, creating vacancies. Then Electrons from higher energy levels then fall into these lower energy vacancies, releasing energy in the form of characteristic X-rays.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: In the laboratory, a cart experiences a single horizontal force as it moves horizontally in a straight line. Of the following data collected about this experiment, which is sufficient to determine the work done on the cart by the horizontal force?\nA) The magnitude of the force, the cart's initial speed, and the cart's final speed\nB) The mass of the cart, the cart's initial speed, and the cart's final speed\nC) The mass of the cart and the distance the cart moved\nD) The mass of the cart and the magnitude of the force\nThought: Let's think step by step. Option A allows us to calculate the change in kinetic energy of the cart, which can be equated to the work done if no other forces are doing work. The work-energy principle states that the net work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy. Therefore, knowing the initial and final speeds allows us to calculate it, and knowing the magnitude of the force enables consideration of non-conservative work scenarios. Option B allows calculation of the change in kinetic energy, but cannot directly calculate the work done by the force alone without the force magnitude. Option C does not know the force applied, so cannot calculate the work. Option D is insufficient because no moved distance.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: A uniform bar is lying on a flat table. Besides the gravitational and normal forces (which cancel), the bar is acted upon by two other forces, F1 and F2, which are parallel to the surface of the table. If the net force on the rod is zero, then which one of the following is true?\nA) The net torque on the bar must also be zero.\nB) The bar can accelerate translationally if F1 and F2 are not applied at the same point.\nC) The net torque will be zero if F1 and F2 are applied at the same point.\nD) The bar cannot accelerate translationally or rotationally.\nThought: Let's think step by step. In option A, if F1 and F2 are equal in magnitude but applied at different points or at different angles relative to any point, the net torque could still be nonzero. In option B, Since the net force on the bar is zero, according to Newton’s first law (the law of inertia), the bar cannot accelerate translationally regardless of where the forces are applied. In option C, ff both forces are applied at exactly the same point, regardless of their directions, their torques will cancel each other out if they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. In option D, the bar can still rotate (accelerate rotationally) if there is a net torque. So the answer is C.\nAnswer: C"}
