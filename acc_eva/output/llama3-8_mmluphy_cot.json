Given that the quantum efficiency is 0.1 and 100 photons are sent into the detector, we can calculate the average number of detected photons as 0.1 * 100 = 10. The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of detected photons in a photon detector. The standard deviation (\u03c3) of the Poisson distribution is the square root of the mean (\u03bc). In this case, \u03bc = 10, so \u03c3 = \u221a10 \u2248 3.16. Therefore, the rms deviation is approximately 3."

In this case, the mass is attached to a spring and is displaced from its equilibrium position. As it passes through its equilibrium position, it has a speed of 0.040 m/s. We can use the conservation of energy principle to find the total mechanical energy. The initial potential energy stored in the spring is converted to kinetic energy as the mass passes through its equilibrium position. We can use the equation for the potential energy of a spring: U = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. We can also use the equation for the kinetic energy: K = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the speed. Since the system is in the absence of friction, the total mechanical energy is conserved. Therefore, the initial potential energy is equal to the final kinetic energy. We can set up the equation: (1/2)kx^2 = (1/2)mv^2. We can solve for k: k = m * v^2 / x^2. We can then find the total mechanical energy: E = (1/2)kx^2 + (1/2)mv^2. Substituting the values, we get: E = (1/2) * (m * v^2 / x^2) * x^2 + (1/2) * m * v^2.

However, the question asks for the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors, not the normal and tangential directions. Since the acceleration is increasing, it is not purely centripetal, but also has a tangential component. The angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is the angle between the tangential direction and the resultant of the centripetal and tangential accelerations. Since the tangential acceleration is 10 m/s^2 and the centripetal acceleration is v^2/r = (10 m/s)^2 / 10 m = 10 m/s^2, the resultant acceleration is sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) m/s^2.

The energy required to remove the second electron is less than the energy required to remove the first electron because the helium ion has a +1 charge, which reduces the attractive force between the remaining electron and the nucleus. Therefore, the energy required to remove the first electron is greater than the energy required to remove the second electron. Since the total energy required to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV, we can set up the equation: Ionization energy + Energy required to remove the second electron = 79.0 eV.

We can use the equation W = F * d to find the work done by the force, where F is the magnitude of the force and d is the distance traveled.

This means that O' is moving in the same direction as one of the sources of light. Since O' sees one source flash 13 ns before the other, it means that the light from the source that flashed first had to travel a longer distance to reach O' than the light from the source that flashed second. The distance between the two sources is 10 m, and the time difference is 13 ns. We can use the formula v = d / t to find the speed of O' relative to O. First, we need to convert the time from ns to s: 13 ns = 13 * 10^-9 s. Then, we can plug in the values: v = 10 m / (13 * 10^-9 s) = 7.69 * 10^7 m/s. This is approximately 0.25c, but we need to find the correct answer from the options. Since the speed of light is c = 3 * 10^8 m/s, we can divide 0.25c by the options to find the correct answer. 0.25c / 0.13c = 1.92, 0.25c / 0.15c = 1.67, 0.25c / 0.36c = 0.69, 0.25c / 0.53c = 0.47.

Since the box is on a horizontal surface, the normal force is equal to the weight of the box, which is mg. So, F_f = \u03bcmg. The force of friction is opposing the motion of the box, so it is doing negative work on the box. The work-energy principle states that the net work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy. Since the box comes to rest, its final kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the work done by the force of friction is equal to the initial kinetic energy of the box, which is (1/2)mv0^2. We can set up the equation: F_f * d = (1/2)mv0^2, where d is the distance the box slides. Substituting F_f = \u03bcmg, we get \u03bcmgd = (1/2)mv0^2. Solving for d, we get d = v0^2/(2\u03bcg)."

The average force exerted on the container by the gas is proportional to the pressure of the gas, which is determined by the number of molecules and the temperature of the gas. Since the containers are at the same temperature and the number of molecules is not specified, we cannot compare the average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas and the nitrogen gas.

Since the containers are identical, the volume of the gas in each container is the same. The mass of the gas in each container is proportional to the number of molecules and the mass of a single molecule.

As the person's body heat flows into the surrounding water, the warmer water near the person rises, creating convection currents. This allows fresh, cold water to come into contact with the person, increasing the rate of heat transfer and making it difficult for the person to warm up. This process is much more efficient than the slow heat transfer that occurs when a person is standing outside on a cold day, where the primary mechanism of heat loss is radiation and conduction through the air."

Since the cross-sectional area is proportional to the square of the diameter (A = \u03c0 * (d/2)^2), we can write Q = \u03c0 * (d/2)^2 * v. Since Q is constant, we can set up a proportion: \u03c0 * (d1/2)^2 * v1 = \u03c0 * (d2/2)^2 * v2, where d1 and d2 are the diameters at the two points and v1 and v2 are the flow speeds at the two points.

Since the pipe splits into three paths, each with a radius of Q/2, the cross-sectional area of each path is (Q/2)^2. Therefore, the flow speed through each path is 2 times the original flow speed V, divided by the square root of 3 (since there are three paths), which is approximately 2/\u221a3 V.

Since the object is acted upon by three external forces, each of magnitude 4 N, the net force acting on the object is 4 N + 4 N + 4 N = 12 N. The mass of the object is 2 kg. We can use the equation F_net = ma to find the acceleration of the object. Rearranging the equation to solve for acceleration, we get a = F_net / m. Plugging in the values, we get a = 12 N / 2 kg = 6 m/s^2. However, this is not among the options. But we can see that the maximum possible acceleration would be when all three forces are in the same direction, which is 12 N / 2 kg = 6 m/s^2. If any of the forces are in the opposite direction, the acceleration would be less than 6 m/s^2. Therefore, the maximum possible acceleration is 6 m/s^2, and the minimum possible acceleration is 0 m/s^2. Since the options are 0 m/s^2, 2 m/s^2, 4 m/s^2, and 8 m/s^2, the option that could NOT be the resulting acceleration of the object is 8 m/s^2."

Since the proton is moving in a circular path, the force is also given by F = (mv^2)/r, where m is the mass of the proton and r is the radius of the circle. Equating these two expressions for the force, we get (mv^2)/r = qvBsin(\u03b8). We can rearrange this equation to get v = (qBr)/(m) = (qBsin(\u03b8))/m. Since the proton is moving in a circular path, its acceleration is given by a = v^2/r. We can use this equation to find the radius of the circle, which is given by r = v^2/a. Substituting the expression for v from the previous equation, we get r = ((qBsin(\u03b8))/m)^2/a.

Since the motor is AC, we need to consider the root mean square (RMS) values of the voltage and current. However, the problem does not provide the RMS values, so we will assume that the given values are RMS values. The power input to the motor is P = V * I = 120V * 1.0A = 120W. The efficiency of the motor is given as 75%, so the output power is P_out = P_in * efficiency = 120W * 0.75 = 90W. The output power is also given by P_out = F * v, where F is the force applied by the motor and v is the speed at which the motor lifts the mass. Since the force applied by the motor is equal to the weight of the mass (F = m * g), we can write P_out = m * g * v. We can now equate the two expressions for P_out and solve for v: m * g * v = P_out => v = P_out / (m * g). Plugging in the values, we get v = 90W / (6kg * 9.8m/s^2) = 1.84m/s.
